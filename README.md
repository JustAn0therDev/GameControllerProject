# GameControllerProject
An API for creating a system to control games with categories and other stuff. Made using the .NET Framework 4.7. 

The patterns I used for the project were DDD with migrations (for the code architeture) and the Observer Design Pattern, with a library that implements the Observer Design Pattern in it (although you can implement your own).
